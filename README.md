# Backbone-Test

Testing backbone.js for basic CRUD functions. Added also sorting and drag and drop.

Todo:

Sorting or drag and drop doesn't work correctly when combined to updating fields. 

- There should be added some kind of editing variable which would know the changes which would know unsaved changes
- Other option is modify rendering function or start using virtual DOM
